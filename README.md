# FinalYearProject

List of programs to get working: 
  - Motion Sensors
      - Reacting to time home
  - Build a skill for Alexa
  - Google Calendar API Integration. 
  - Google Maps Integration. (Done.)
  
  
  Google Maps Integration program is ran at 16:00 every day, checks commute home and will text the user if their commute is
  delayed by 'X' amount. Will advise on the route that is causing issues. 
  
  Sample text: 
    'Your quickest route home is delayed by 'X' minutes. Due to traffic on the 'Road Name' in 'City'. I'd suggest
    going a different way.'
