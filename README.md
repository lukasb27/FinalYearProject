# FinalYearProject

List of programs to get working: 
  - Motion Sensors
      - Reacting to time home
  - Build a skill for Alexa
  - Google Calendar API Integration. 
  - Google Maps Integration. (Done, just need to tidy code and add functions)
  
  
  Google Maps Integration program is ran at 16:00 every day, checks commute home and will text the user if their commute is
  delayed by 'X' amount. Will advise on the route that is causing issues. Just need to tidy up code and add functions.
  
  Sample text: 
    'Your quickest route home is delayed by 'X' minutes. Due to traffic on the 'Road Name' in 'City'. I'd suggest
    going a different way.'
  
  All modules now finished.
